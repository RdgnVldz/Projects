## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./images/Screenshot 1.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.card{
      border-radius: 20px;
      padding:15px;
      align-items: center;
      text-align: center;
      position: fixed;
      top: 50%;
      left: 50%;
      -webkit-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
      width: 300px;
      background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
